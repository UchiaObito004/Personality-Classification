# Personality-Classification
This project is a  machine learning model that predicts whether a person is an extrovert or introvert. It uses a Random Forest Classifier trained on labeled data to learn patterns and make predictions. The goal is to demonstrate a basic classification approach using Python and Scikit-learn.
